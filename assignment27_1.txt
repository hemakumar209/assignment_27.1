1. Return the categories (names) of the longest film. NOTE that there may be several "longest"
films (i.e. with the same length), so you might need to return more than one category. Return
the duration as well.
    Ans:
    SET @length_max=(select max(length) from film);



    select title, length, rental_duration
 
    from film where length=@length_max;
   
    RESULT:
     
           title	     length	   rental_duration
       CONTROL ANTHEM	       185	        7
       DARN FORRESTER  	       185	        7
       HOME PITY	       185	        7
       MUSCLE BRIGHT	       185	        7
       POND SEATTLE	       185	        7
       SOLDIERS EVOLUTION      185	        7
       CHICAGO NORTH	       185       	6
       GANGS PRIDE	       185	        4
       WORST BANGER	       185	        4
       SWEET BROTHERHOOD       185      	3


2. Find the movies whose total number of actors is above the average. Return the movie names
and its number of actors ordered by the title. IMPORTANT NOTE: this query should return many
movies. Please write in your submission only the first TOP-10 results.
    Ans:
      create view num_actors_in_eachfilm as 
     
 select film_id,count(1) as cnt
	      
      from film_actor
           
      group by film_id
              
      having count(film_id)>1;

      SET @avg_num_actors=(select avg (cnt) from num_actors_in_eachfilm);

      
select title,cnt
      from film f
 join num_actors_in_eachfilm nu
     
 on nu.film_id = f.film_id
 
      where cnt > @avg_num_actors

      order by cnt desc;

    RESULT:

    writing only top 10 results

           title	    cnt
